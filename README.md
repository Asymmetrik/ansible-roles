Reusable Ansible roles

# System Requirements

These roles have only been tested with:
* Mac OS X 10.12 (Sierra)
* Ansible 2.1.1.0

In addition, some of the roles specifically target the RedHat OS family,
including CentOS and Amazon Linux, and may not function for other host OS's.

If you are interested in other versions, please provide patches.

# Getting Started

hosts
=====

An Ansible role to:

1. Set hostname
1. Configure hosts file to contain all systems in the inventory within a specific environment

Requirements
------------

- Machines must be tagged in the inventory with an 'env' tag, and an 'env'
  extra-var must be used when running.
- Role assumes EC2 inventory variables, and will use the private IP address, private DNS name, and 'Name' tag in the hosts file. For example:

    10.0.0.0   ip-10-0-0-0.ec2.internal  host1
    10.0.0.1   ip-10-0-0-1.ec2.internal  host2
    10.0.0.2   ip-10-0-0-2.ec2.internal  host3

Role Variables
--------------

The variables that can be passed to this role and a brief description about
them are as follows.

    # value to set as the hostname
    hosts_hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"

    # absolute path to the hosts file
    hosts_dest: /etc/hosts

    # whether to create a backup of the hosts file
    hosts_backup: yes

    # optional hosts file entries
    hosts_extra_entries:
      - { ip: '127.0.0.1', hosts: [ 'hostname1', 'hostname2' ] }
      - { ip: '127.0.0.2', hosts: [ 'hostname3', 'hostname4' ] }

Example Playbook
----------------

This example sets the hostname to the EC2 private DNS name:

    - name: Configure Hosts
      become: yes
      become_method: sudo
      remote_user: "{{ remote_user | default(omit) }}"
      hosts: servers
      roles:
        - name: Configure Hostnames
          role: hosts
          hosts_hostname: "{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ec2_private_dns_name'] }}"
